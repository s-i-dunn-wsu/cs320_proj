sudo apt get install python3-venv

// can create the venv anywhere
python3 -m venv <name of virtual env> // creates virtual environment

// in the same directory as your venv
ls <name of env>/bin // you should see an activate file

source <name of env>/bin/activate // this will put you in the virtual env

// once you're in your env you don't have to specify python3, you can just do python

// cd into the cs320_proj

pip install -r requirements.txt // pip reads the file and installs them in the venv


open browser  > ctrl o > navigate to project > build/html > open index.html

making another .rst file will make another page > put them under refdocs folder > follow the template


Creating/Editing a new page:
refdocs: cs320_proj > sphnix > source > refdocs > create new file > nameOfFile.rst

** easiest to copy/paste from existing template to follow the form

**IMPORTANT**
open > index.rst (which is in the refdocs file from above) > add name of .rst file to the list of file names

// to see the site
cd sphinx
make clean; make html // creates the website


Git for VS Code: 
Source Control Tab (Left hand side menu) > press + to commit changes > ... (more actions menu) > push



deactivte // exits out of env


** do not murder env until you're completely done with the project - deactivate instead



other:
// anything before the ; if it doesn't build what's after the ; will still build
// stuff1 && stuff2 -- if stuff1 doesn't build then stuff2 won't build  
make clean; make html && execute whatever
