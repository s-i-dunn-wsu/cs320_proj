# Promt Strings

This folder contains localizations for strings to pre-populate the browser-editor
with before the user starts working on their code.

- These strings will be inserted as-is into the editor.
- can be localized using typical two-letter designations (en->english, es->spanish, etc.).
- are saved in accordance to the suite they represent. (ex, suite-1's prompt string is in 1.txt)
