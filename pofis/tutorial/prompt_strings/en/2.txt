# This module walks you through defining and calling functions.

# Functions encapsulate behavior for multiple uses.

# Here is an example of a function that adds 3 to whatever
# input it is given
def add_3(x):
    return x + 3

# the 'def' tells the python interpreter that you're
# defining a new function.

# Please define a new function 'my_func' that
# takes a singular input and returns its square.
# Please recall that consistent indentation is important to the Python interpreter

# your code here

# Python provides several builtin functions, such as the 'print' function.
# print takes its input and prints the string form of it to stdout.
# Please try printing 'Hello World' now.
