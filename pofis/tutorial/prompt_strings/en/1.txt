# This module will help you lean basic syntax and arithmetic.
# These lines are comment lines. In Python the '#' symbol starts a comment.

# The following line shows basic variable assignment.
x = 1
# Variables are used to store data.

# You can perform simple arithmetic on literals (such as the number 1)
# or on variables.
x = x + 2

# Now try adding 3 to x.


# You can create new variables from the result of arithmetic.
# Try creating a new variable, y, by assigning the result of x + x to it.

# You're not limited to simple addition, other operators include:
# -  : subtraction
# *  : multiplication
# /  : Floating point division
# // : Integral division
# %  : modulo arithmetic

# When you have all of these finished, press the 'submit' button.
